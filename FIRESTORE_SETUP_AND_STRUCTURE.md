# Firestore Database Setup and Structure for iiCaptain

This guide explains how to set up your Firestore database in the Firebase console and outlines the data structure that the iiCaptain application is designed to work with.

## 1. Creating Firestore Database in Firebase Console

If you haven't already, you need to create a Firestore database instance for your Firebase project:

1.  **Go to your Firebase Project:** Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your project.
2.  **Navigate to Firestore Database:** In the left-hand navigation pane, under "Build", click on "Firestore Database".
3.  **Create Database:**
    *   Click the "Create database" button.
    *   **Choose a mode:**
        *   **Production mode:** Starts with secure rules (denying all access by default). This is recommended. You will need to add security rules later (see section 4).
        *   **Test mode:** Starts with open rules (allowing all reads/writes for 30 days). Useful for initial development but **must be secured before production.**
    *   **Choose a location:** Select the region where your data will be stored. This cannot be changed later. Choose a location close to your users.
    *   Click "Enable".

Your Firestore database is now ready.

## 2. Firestore Data Structure

The application uses the following collection and subcollection structure to support multi-tenancy (each team has its own environment) and roles (admin, member).

### Collection: `teams`

This is a top-level collection where each document represents a unique team.

*   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore (this ID is referred to as `teamId` in the application).
*   **Fields:**
    *   `name`: (String) The name of the team (e.g., "The Eagles").
    *   `ownerUid`: (String) The Firebase Auth UID of the user who created/owns the team. This user is typically the first admin.
    *   `createdAt`: (Timestamp) Server timestamp indicating when the team was created.
    *   `inviteCode`: (String) A shareable code for new members to join this team. Generated on team creation, resettable by admins.

*   **Subcollection of `teams/{teamId}`: `matches`**
    *   Stores all matches for a specific team.

## 4. Initial Data and Security Rules

*   **Initial Data:**
    *   When a new user signs up with no invite code, they provide a **Team Name** and their **own name**.
    *   The app then:
        1.  Creates their Firebase Authentication account.
        2.  Creates a new team document in the `teams` collection with the provided team name, a generated `inviteCode`, and sets the new user as `ownerUid`.
        3.  Creates their user profile document in the `users` collection, linking them to the newly created `teamId` and setting `isAdmin: true` and default participation booleans.
    *   When a new user signs up with a valid `inviteCode`:
        1.  Creates their Firebase Authentication account.
        2.  Finds the `teamId` associated with the `inviteCode`.
        3.  Creates their user profile document in the `users` collection, linking them to the found `teamId` and setting `isAdmin: false` and default participation booleans.
    *   Admins can edit member profiles (including their boolean roles/permissions) from the Team Settings page.
    *   Matches, Trainings, and Refereeing Assignments are added by team admins. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Messages are added by team admins. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Support tickets are created by any authenticated user.

*   **Firestore Security Rules (VERY IMPORTANT):**
    *   Default security rules are restrictive. You **must** configure Firestore Security Rules.
    *   These rules enforce multi-tenancy and role-based access.
    *   **If you encounter "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, double-check these rules and user document data.**

    **Security Rules:**

## 5. Required Firestore Indexes

*   **Collection:** `teams`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `inviteCode` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection (For looking up teams by invite code during signup)

*   **Collection Group:** `matches`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `trainings`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group
    *   *Note*: This index is specifically used by `getTrainings` when `filter` is "active". If you add other complex queries, more indexes might be needed.

*   **Collection Group:** `refereeingAssignments`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `messages`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `createdAt` (Descending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group
    
*   **Collection Group:** `playerStats` (Under `teams/{teamId}/matches/{matchId}/playerStats`)
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `playerId` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group (For aggregating player stats across all matches for a specific player)

*   **Collection Group:** `availability` (For `matches` subcollection)
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `playerId` (Ascending) // Or other fields if querying across all availabilities
        2. `status` (Ascending) // Example for complex queries
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group
    *   *(Note: Simpler queries for a single event's availability might not need a complex index.)*

*   **Collection Group:** `availability` (For `trainings` subcollection - same as above if structure is identical)

*   **Collection:** `users`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `teamId` (Ascending)
        2. `name` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection

*   **Collection:** `users`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `teamId` (Ascending)
        2. `isAdmin` (Ascending) // If you need to query admins within a team
        3. `name` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection

*   **Collection:** `tickets`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `userId` (Ascending)
        2. `createdAt` (Descending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection

**Note on Index Creation Time:** Composite indexes can take a few minutes to build.

By following this structure, implementing robust security rules, and creating the necessary indexes, your iiCaptain application will have a solid foundation for managing team data securely and efficiently.

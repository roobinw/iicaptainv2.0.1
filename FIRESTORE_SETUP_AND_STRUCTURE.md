# Firestore Database Setup and Structure for iiCaptain

This guide explains how to set up your Firestore database in the Firebase console and outlines the data structure that the iiCaptain application is designed to work with.

## 1. Creating Firestore Database in Firebase Console

If you haven't already, you need to create a Firestore database instance for your Firebase project:

1.  **Go to your Firebase Project:** Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your project.
2.  **Navigate to Firestore Database:** In the left-hand navigation pane, under "Build", click on "Firestore Database".
3.  **Create Database:**
    *   Click the "Create database" button.
    *   **Choose a mode:**
        *   **Production mode:** Starts with secure rules (denying all access by default). This is recommended. You will need to add security rules later (see section 4).
        *   **Test mode:** Starts with open rules (allowing all reads/writes for 30 days). Useful for initial development but **must be secured before production.**
    *   **Choose a location:** Select the region where your data will be stored. This cannot be changed later. Choose a location close to your users.
    *   Click "Enable".

Your Firestore database is now ready.

## 2. Firestore Data Structure

The application uses the following collection and subcollection structure to support multi-tenancy (each team has its own environment) and roles (admin, player).

### Collection: `teams`

This is a top-level collection where each document represents a unique team.

*   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore (this ID is referred to as `teamId` in the application).
*   **Fields:**
    *   `name`: (String) The name of the team (e.g., "The Eagles").
    *   `ownerUid`: (String) The Firebase Auth UID of the user who created/owns the team. This user is typically the first admin.
    *   `createdAt`: (Timestamp) Server timestamp indicating when the team was created.

*   **Subcollection of `teams/{teamId}`: `matches`**
    *   Stores all matches for a specific team.
    *   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore.
    *   **Fields:**
        *   `date`: (String) Match date in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.

## 4. Initial Data and Security Rules

*   **Initial Data:**
    *   When a new user signs up via the app, they also provide a **Team Name** and their **own name**.
    *   The app then:
        1.  Creates their Firebase Authentication account.
        2.  Creates a new team document in the `teams` collection with the provided team name and sets the new user as `ownerUid`.
        3.  Creates their user profile document in the `users` collection (using their Firebase Auth UID as the document ID and the `uid` field), linking them to the newly created `teamId` and assigning them the `role: "admin"`.
    *   Admins can then add other player profiles to their team via the "Players" page in the app. This:
        1. Creates a new Firebase Authentication account for the player using an email and password provided by the admin.
        2. Creates a `users` document for that player (using the new player's Firebase Auth UID as the document ID and the `uid` field), with `role: "player"` and the admin's `teamId`.
    *   Matches, Trainings, and Refereeing Assignments are added by team admins through the app into their respective team's subcollections. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Messages are added by team admins via the dashboard message board. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Locations are added by team admins via the app into their team's `locations` subcollection.
    *   Support tickets are created by any authenticated user via the "Support" page.

*   **Firestore Security Rules (VERY IMPORTANT):**
    *   Default security rules (especially in "Production mode") are highly restrictive. You **must** configure Firestore Security Rules.
    *   These rules enforce multi-tenancy (a user can only access data for their own team) and role-based access (only an admin can create/modify team-wide data like matches or other player profiles within their team).
    *   **Carefully copy and paste the rules below into the Firebase console Rules editor.**
    *   **If you encounter "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, double-check that these rules are correctly applied and that your `users/{uid}` documents contain the correct `teamId` and `role` for the authenticated user.**

    **Security Rules:**
    ```firestore-rules
    rules_version = '2';

    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {

        // Helper function to get requesting user's data (role, teamId)
        // Returns user data if document exists, otherwise null.
        function getUserAuthData() {
          // Construct the path string correctly using string concatenation for dynamic parts like request.auth.uid
          let userDocumentPath = path('/databases/' + database + '/documents/users/' + request.auth.uid);
          return exists(userDocumentPath) ? get(userDocumentPath).data : null;
        }

    *   **Test your security rules thoroughly** using the Firebase console's Rules Playground before deploying your app widely. This allows you to simulate requests as different users and see if the rules grant or deny access as expected.

## 5. Required Firestore Indexes

Certain queries in the application, especially those involving multiple `orderBy` clauses or `where` filters on different fields, require composite indexes in Firestore. If these indexes are not present, the queries will fail, and you might see errors like "The query requires an index..." or generic data fetching errors in the app.

You can create these indexes in the Firebase console:
1.  Go to your Firebase Project -> Firestore Database -> Indexes.
2.  Click on "Composite" and then "Create Index".
3.  For each index listed below, enter the "Collection ID" (or "Collection group ID" if specified) and add the fields exactly as shown with their respective order (Ascending/Descending).

*   **Collection Group:** `matches`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `date` (Ascending)
        2.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `matches` (For filtering archived matches)
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group


*   **Collection Group:** `trainings`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `date` (Ascending)
        2.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `trainings` (For filtering archived trainings)
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `refereeingAssignments`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `date` (Ascending)
        2.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `refereeingAssignments` (For filtering archived assignments)
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `date` (Ascending)
        3.  `time` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `messages`
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `createdAt` (Descending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection Group:** `messages` (For filtering archived messages)
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `isArchived` (Ascending)
        2.  `createdAt` (Descending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group
    
*   **Collection Group:** `locations` (NEW - For sorting locations by name)
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `name` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection group

*   **Collection:** `users`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `teamId` (Ascending)
        2. `name` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection

*   **Collection:** `users`
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `teamId` (Ascending)
        2. `role` (Ascending)
        3. `name` (Ascending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection

*   **Collection:** `tickets` 
    *   **Fields:**
        1. `userId` (Ascending)
        2. `createdAt` (Descending)
    *   **Query scope:** Collection


**Note on Index Creation Time:** Composite indexes can take a few minutes to build, especially if you already have data in your collections. Firestore will indicate the status of index creation in the console.

By following this structure, implementing robust security rules, and creating the necessary indexes, your iiCaptain application will have a solid foundation for managing team data securely and efficiently for multiple teams.

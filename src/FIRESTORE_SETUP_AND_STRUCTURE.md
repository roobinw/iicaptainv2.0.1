# Firestore Database Setup and Structure for iiCaptain

This guide explains how to set up your Firestore database in the Firebase console and outlines the data structure that the iiCaptain application is designed to work with.

## 1. Creating Firestore Database in Firebase Console

If you haven't already, you need to create a Firestore database instance for your Firebase project:

1.  **Go to your Firebase Project:** Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your project.
2.  **Navigate to Firestore Database:** In the left-hand navigation pane, under "Build", click on "Firestore Database".
3.  **Create Database:**
    *   Click the "Create database" button.
    *   **Choose a mode:**
        *   **Production mode:** Starts with secure rules (denying all access by default). This is recommended. You will need to add security rules later (see section 4).
        *   **Test mode:** Starts with open rules (allowing all reads/writes for 30 days). Useful for initial development but **must be secured before production.**
    *   **Choose a location:** Select the region where your data will be stored. This cannot be changed later. Choose a location close to your users.
    *   Click "Enable".

Your Firestore database is now ready.

## 2. Firestore Data Structure

The application uses the following collection and subcollection structure to support multi-tenancy (each team has its own environment) and roles (admin, member).

### Collection: `teams`

This is a top-level collection where each document represents a unique team.

*   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore (this ID is referred to as `teamId` in the application).
*   **Fields:**
    *   `name`: (String) The name of the team (e.g., "The Eagles").
    *   `ownerUid`: (String) The Firebase Auth UID of the user who created/owns the team. This user is typically the first admin.
    *   `createdAt`: (Timestamp) Server timestamp indicating when the team was created.

*   **Subcollection of `teams/{teamId}`: `matches`**
    *   Stores all matches for a specific team.
    *   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore.
    *   **Fields:**
        *   `date`: (String) Match date in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
        *   `time`: (String) Match time in "HH:mm" format (24-hour).

            *   Example: `{"firebaseUserUid1": "present", "firebaseUserUid2": "absent"}`
        *   `isArchived`: (Boolean) `true` if the match is archived, `false` otherwise. Defaults to `false`.


*   **Subcollection of `teams/{teamId}`: `trainings`**
    *   Stores all training sessions for a specific team.
    *   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore.
    *   **Fields:**

        *   `assignedPlayerUids`: (Array of Strings) Firebase Auth UIDs of the members assigned to referee. (Note: "Player" here refers to team members, aligned with Firestore structure)
        *   `notes`: (String, optional) Additional details or instructions for the assignment.
        *   `isArchived`: (Boolean) `true` if the assignment is archived, `false` otherwise. Defaults to `false`.

*   **Subcollection of `teams/{teamId}`: `messages`**

## 4. Initial Data and Security Rules

*   **Initial Data:**
    *   When a new user signs up via the app, they also provide a **Team Name** and their **own name**.
    *   The app then:
        1.  Creates their Firebase Authentication account.
        2.  Creates a new team document in the `teams` collection with the provided team name and sets the new user as `ownerUid`.
        3.  Creates their user profile document in the `users` collection (using their Firebase Auth UID as the document ID and the `uid` field), linking them to the newly created `teamId`, assigning them the `role: "admin"`, and setting default boolean roles (e.g., `isTrainingMember: true`, `isMatchMember: true`, `isTeamManager: true`, others `false`).
    *   Admins can then add other member profiles to their team via the "Members" page in the app. This:
        1. Creates a new Firebase Authentication account for the member using an email and password provided by the admin.
        2. Creates a `users` document for that member (using the new member's Firebase Auth UID as the document ID and the `uid` field), with `role: "member"`, the admin's `teamId`, and specified boolean roles (defaulting to `isTrainingMember: true`, `isMatchMember: true`, others `false` if not specified by form).
    *   Matches, Trainings, and Refereeing Assignments are added by team admins through the app into their respective team's subcollections. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Messages are added by team admins via the dashboard message board. They default to `isArchived: false`.
    *   Locations are added by team admins via the app into their team's `locations` subcollection.
    *   Support tickets are created by any authenticated user via the "Support" page.

*   **Firestore Security Rules (VERY IMPORTANT):**
    *   Default security rules (especially in "Production mode") are highly restrictive. You **must** configure Firestore Security Rules.
    *   These rules enforce multi-tenancy (a user can only access data for their own team) and role-based access (only an admin can create/modify team-wide data like matches or other member profiles within their team).
    *   **Carefully copy and paste the rules below into the Firebase console Rules editor.**
    *   **If you encounter "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, double-check that these rules are correctly applied and that your `users/{uid}` documents contain the correct `teamId` and `role` for the authenticated user.**

    **Security Rules:**
    ```firestore-rules
    rules_version = '2';

    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {

        // Helper function to get requesting user's data (role, teamId)
        // Returns user data if document exists, otherwise null.
        function getUserAuthData() {
          // Construct the path string correctly using string concatenation for dynamic parts like request.auth.uid
          let userDocumentPath = path('/databases/' + database + '/documents/users/' + request.auth.uid);
          return exists(userDocumentPath) ? get(userDocumentPath).data : null;
        }

        // Helper: Is the user signed in?
        function isSignedIn() {
          return request.auth != null;
        }

        }

        // (used when document ID is the user's auth UID)
        function isOwner(userId) {
          return request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }

        // Teams collection
        match /teams/{teamId} {
          // Any authenticated user who is part of this team can read team details.
          allow read: if isUserTeamMember(teamId);

          // 1. A user creating their own profile (documentId {userId} == auth.uid).
